## Overview
Calculator Web App

Features: 
- Three colour themes, selectable via a toggle input
- Basic calculator functionality, including decimal points
- Delete: backspaces the last input
- Reset: resets the calculator
- Keyboard input for calculations
- Responsive design
- Special handling of touch inputs for better user experience on touch screens

Known limitations: 
- The calculator can handle and display negative numbers, but the user cannot input negative numbers themself currently
- The calculator can only display a maximum of 11 digits on the screen. Therefore inputs are limited to this amount of digits, and calculation results that exceed this will show an 'Out of range' message. 

## Technologies

- CSS
- JavaScript

## Motivation
